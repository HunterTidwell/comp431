		<h1>Story Time</h1>
		<p>I once stole a pirate ship. Okay, not a real pirate ship -- it was a scale model of a pirate ship, built on a pontoon. But it had sails and portholes, and it looked mean as hell. And one summer, long ago, along with the members of BSA Troop 217, I stole it.</p>
		<p>It was the last night of summer camp on Old Hickory Lake. Long after the evening's activities had ended, and the last bonfires had been put out, the lake's surface was still and smooth as ice. Suddenly, silently, a procession of canoes slipped onto the water. We paddled, three to a canoe, around the point at the edge of camp. There, in a cove, the pirate ship was moored.</p>
		<p>A solitary diver left his canoe and swam beneath the looming vessel. With his trusty pocket knife he began to cut the ropes holding the ship in place, returning for breath as we waited tensely above. After several minutes, the ship was free. We tied the ship's mooring ropes to our canoes and began the journey back to camp.</p>
		<p>The next morning, campers were all talking about the newcomer to the waterfront. Beside the roped-off swimming hole, next to the rowboats and sailboats, a mysterious schooner had arrived overnight. Most of the older campers had seen the ship in its old home, but I can only imagine the curiosity in the minds of the younger generations present. Eventually some boring camp staff were able to find a fishing boat and remove the pirate ship from its ostentatious position at the end of the dock. But to this day, campers on that lake are wary of pirates, and you might hear one tell the tale of the ghost ship of Old Hickory Lake. </p>
