So my starting idea is this:
Make the tiles html elements,
arrange them using css classes.
use a fixed board size (5x5 tiles, 400x400px should work)
hope the whole thing rescales onto mobile. don't worry, don't prioritize that for now.
with this model the game should take ~5 hours to complete.
I have 25 starting now at 1 am on thursday. Let's do this.
